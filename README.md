### Hey there âœ¨
My name is Yuxi, and I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student at McMaster University (expected to graduate Apr 2027).
- ðŸš™ As Data Acquisition lead on [McMaster Baja Racing](https://www.mcmasterbaja.ca), I lead a team of 23 students to integrate sensors, analyze data, and develop testing solutions for a custom off-road vehicle. (This is what I spend all my time working on!)
- ðŸš— My time as a Test Engineer at [General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada](https://app.gdls.com/) allowed me to support military test plans, install sensors, and create wire harnesses for Light Armoured Vehicles.
- ðŸ’¼ I've worked as an Automation Engineer at [Volante Systems](https://www.volantesystems.com).
- ðŸ’» As a Board Member for [Hack the 6ix](https://www.hackthe6ix.com) (HT6), I support the organizing team for Toronto's biggest summer hackathon.
